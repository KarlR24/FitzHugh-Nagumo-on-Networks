# FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics on Networks
Python implementation of a network with local FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics.
Every node of the network is a FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron which is coupled to its nearest neighbors. \
Here, the ODE is approximated according to the [Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method). \
The class is built according to [fabridamicelli's Kuramoto repository](https://github.com/fabridamicelli/kuramoto) and rewritten for FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics. 

This repository contains:
 - a class which computes the time evolution of the local FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics for given parameter values and network
 - different visualizations of the dynamics 

FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics for node i: \
$\dot{v_i} = v_i - \frac{v_i^3}{3} - w_i + \frac{k}{N}* \sum_{j =1,...,N} a_{ij} (v_i - v_j)$ \
$\dot{w_i} = \frac{1}{\tau} (v_i - bw_i + a)$ \
where $a_{ij}$ denotes the entries of the adjacency matrix (for a given network) and $N$ is the number of nodes. \
Remark: Depending on the choice of parameters in the model the behaviour change qualitatively (saddle node bifurcation, limit cycles, Hopf bifurcation, etc.). 

## Given network with local FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics:
     coupling = 1
     G = nx.watts_strogatz_graph(100, 2, 0)
     a = 0.3
     b = 0.1
     tau = 5
     delta_t = 10**(-2)
     T = 5000
     
     FitzHugh_Nagumo_coupled(coupling=coupling, network=G, a=a, b=b, tau=tau, delta_t=delta_t, T=T, initial_states=None) 
          
CPU times: user 1min, sys: 11.5 s, total: 1min 12s

## Visualizations:

### Plot the node activity for both FitzHugh-Nagumo variables
     G = nx.grid_2d_graph(3, 3) 
     model = FitzHugh_Nagumo_coupled(coupling=1, network=G, a=0.3, b=0.1, tau=5, delta_t=10**(-3), T=50) 
     adj_mat = nx.to_numpy_array(G) 
     act_mat=model.run(adj_mat) 
     plot_activity(act_mat)
     
![plot activity v for GitHub, grid 3x3, T=50, dt=0 01](https://github.com/KarlR24/FitzHugh-Nagumo-on-Networks/assets/104760326/1fd45b3d-a7ee-4398-a938-55342e3dc9fe)
![plot activity w for GitHub, grid 3x3, T=50, dt=0 01](https://github.com/KarlR24/FitzHugh-Nagumo-on-Networks/assets/104760326/419bd9eb-2664-4a56-91d1-9c8d6b53bc98)



### Trajectories in the Phase Plane
     G = nx.watts_strogatz_graph(10, 2, 0) 
     a = 0.3
     b = 0.1
     tau = 5
     model = FitzHugh_Nagumo_coupled(coupling=1, network=G, a=a, b=b, tau=tau, delta_t=10**(-2), T=50) 
     adj_mat = nx.to_numpy_array(G) 
     act_mat=model.run(adj_mat) 
     plot_phase_portrait(a, b, tau, act_mat, force_field=True)

force_field=True draws arrows in the direction of the flow \
Note that:
- the nullclines are drawn in blue and orange
- the force_field is drawn for the differential equation without coupling! Therefore, it is not exact and meant to give intuition for the flow.

 ## Pngs to GIF/Video
 
The following functions create sequences of png images which are used to create GIFs/videos. \
There are several different ways to visualize the network dynamics:

### Evolution of the Dynamics on the Network 

The function image_creator visualized the node activity on the network. The network is plotted according to a chosen layout algorithm
and the node activity is colorcoded. \
Afterwards, one can make a GIF (used here) or video with the png images .

Here the initial states = "ins" are chosen such that one node in a corner is perturbed and all other nodes are at the equilibrium. Observe the propagation of the pertubation away from the perturbed node throughout the network.

     G = nx.grid_2d_graph(10, 10) 
     model = FitzHugh_Nagumo_coupled(coupling=1, network=G, a=0.3, b=0.1, tau=0.1, delta_t=10**(-3), T=50, initial_states=ins) 
     act_mat = model.run(adj_mat=nx.to_numpy_array(G))
     pos = nx.spring_layout(G, iterations=500) 
     colormap = matplotlib.cm.twilight 
     stepstart = 100 
     stepsize = 250 

     image_creator(G, act_mat, pos, colormap, stepstart, stepsize)
     GIF_creator(0.05, '/Users/User/FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics/pngs', '/Users/User/FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics/GIF')

### Phase portrait:

The difference between runaround and plot_phase_portrait is that runaround illustrates every oscillator as a dot for a given time point.
The advantage is that for every time point it can be seen where the oscillators are in the phase plane.
     
     G = nx.watts_strogatz_graph(10, 2, 0)
     model = FitzHugh_Nagumo_coupled(coupling=1, network=G, a=0.3, b=0.1, tau=5, delta_t=10**(-2), T=100)
     act_mat = model.run(adj_mat)
     runaround(act_mat, 50, 10000, 50)
     video_maker(0.1, '/Users/User/FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics/pngs', 'runaround')

### Chimera plot

scatter_chim_gif is used to visualize chimera patterns in a network of identical, coupled oscillators. The function creates png images which can be used to make a GIF or video. 

     G = nx.watts_strogatz_graph(100, 20, 0)
     model = FitzHugh_Nagumo_coupled(coupling=100, network=G, a=0.3, b=0.1, tau=5, delta_t=10**(-2), T=500)
     act_mat = model.run(adj_mat)

     scatter_chim_gif(act_mat, 40000, 50)
     video_maker(0.1, '/Users/user/my/directory/pngs', 'chimera')


https://github.com/KarlR24/FitzHugh-Nagumo-on-Networks/assets/104760326/7216da03-6587-448c-ae3e-50f4d652cc77



## Phase Coherence measure:       
Note that (new) random initial states are generated in every simulation run. Every simulation run is one curve in the plot which describes the evolution of the  coherence measure (= synchronicity of the oscillators).
Note that, the acitivity matrix is not stored therefore not available for further analysis. The output of this function is a plot of the phase coherence measure for both variables v, w.

A modified version of the coherence measure $R(t)$ from the following paper is used: 
"The synchronization of FitzHughâ€“Nagumo neuron network coupled by gap junction" - 
Zhan Yong, Zhang Su-Hua, Zhao Tong-Jun, An Hai-Long, Zhang Zhen-Dong, Han Ying-Rong, Liu Hui, and Zhang Yu-Hong
    
Example: For a ring graph with 25 nodes we want to run the dynamics with non-oscillatory parameter choice on it 100 times where for every simulation run new initial states are generated. The initial states are picked according to a uniform distribution and should be in the interval $[-1, 1]$. The rest of the parameters are in the same order as they are in the FitzHughNagumo_on_network class:\

     number_simulation_runs = 100
     initial_states_interval = 1
     coupling = 1
     network_list = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(25, 0.35)
     a = 1.3
     b = 0.7
     tau = 200/3
     delta_t = 10**(-3)
     T = 600

     plot_phase_coherence(number_simulation_runs, initial_states_interval, coupling, network, a, b, tau, delta_t, T) =
     plot_phase_coherence(100, 1, 1, G, 1.3, 0.7, 200/3, 10**(-3), 600)

### coh_gif(phase_coherence_v, simulation_run, stepsize)

To compare the dynamics from image_creator, scatter_chim_gif and runaround we make a GIF/video where a vertical bar is at the current time step. This function is used in the code of phase_coh_freq below!

     coh_gif(phase_coherence_v, simulation_run, stepsize):
          '''
          phase_coherence_v: 2d-array
               phase coherence values for every time step
        
          simulation_run: integer
               simulation run of interest to make GIF
    
          stepsize: float
               after stepsize many iterations the next png is created
          '''
    
Example: Since coh_gif takes its imputs from variables inside the phase_coh_freq function. Therefore, this example only showcases the output images compiled into a video.

### Run simulations and generate above visualizations:

This function combines the class and visualiation function from above to make simulation runs and analyse them. \
Additionally, the activity matrix for the first variable v is plotted as heatmap to be able to link the different visualization together.\
Furthermore, the node activity and the phase coherence measure are decomposed into their frequencies using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\
Note that: phase_coh_freq purpose is to make simulation runs and analysis individual runs with the same function. \
In comparison, the individual functions above can be used for sinlge model realizations to test and visualize


    number_simulation_runs = 3
    range_initial_states = 3

    T = 1000

    last_steps = 10000

    phase_coh_freq(number_simulation_runs, range_initial_states, coupling, network, a, b, tau, delta_t, T, every_x_run, last_steps) = 
    phase_coh_freq(3, 3, 1, G, 0.3, 0.1, 5, 10**(-2), 1000, 10, 10000)
